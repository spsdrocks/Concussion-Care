# Concussion Care

## Inspiration
The problem that we are trying to solve is our healthcare system caused by too many patients that have easily self diagnosable problems such as concussions. By alleviating the strain on the system more patients that are in need can be treated. To achieve this we made a self diagnostic website for concussions. 

## What it does
This website is a questionnaire that goes through the questions a doctor would ask a patient. If the person is able to pass a stage they are prompted with the next questions. This repeats for each stage. If they are unable to answer the questions they will either stay on the stage or be put back a stage depending on how bad their symptoms are.

## How we built it
We used HTML and CSS to build the UI/Website. We used JS to program the questionnaire.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was time. Being our first hackathon we were not expecting to have to do so much work in such a little amount of time. This caused us to cut out a lot of things that we wished to include. It also caused us to sacrifice the visuals for functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a functional product that can impact the world in a positive manner. We are also happy that we managed to make a completed submission. This being our first hackathon we didnâ€™t even know if we would finish anything.

## What we learned
We would work better if we all worked in person together. Furthermore, we hope to one day do an in person hackathon. 

## What's next for Concussion Care
We hope to further expand on the idea of obtaining accurate and fast access to medical information without the need to wait for a doctor. This information will include common diseases and the information obtained from the survey will help the doctor understand what you are feeling.
