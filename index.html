                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em">A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) that occurs when the brain
                            experiences a sudden, rapid movement within the skull, often due to a blow, jolt, or impact
                            to
                            the head or body. This abrupt movement can disrupt normal brain function temporarily.
                            Concussions are common, particularly in activities such as sports, falls, or vehicle
                            accidents.</p>
                        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.75em">How Do I Use This Website?</h2>
                        <p>THis website is made to help quide you through the seven step recovery process of a concussion. Each of these seven steps is made to help you ease back into regular life whether you are a student or worker. Along with a short description, each step has a list of things that you can and can't do. These are here as a suggestion rather than a rule as cocnussions are different for everyone. Either way we recomment following these as it will minimize recovery time. To ensure you have the best recovery each of these steps is designed to take at least 24 hours. Once you have finished with one step, do the quize on the right to see if you are ready for the next one.</p>

                        <h2>Symptoms of Concussion</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Altered Mental State: Individuals with a concussion may experience temporary confusion,
                                disorientation, or a feeling of being dazed. They might have trouble concentrating,
                                memory
                                problems, or difficulty processing information.</li>
                            <li>Physical Symptoms: Common physical symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea,
                                vomiting,
                                blurred vision, sensitivity to light or noise, and balance problems. Some individuals
                                may
                                also report a "pressure" sensation in the head.</li>
                            <li>Emotional and Behavioral Changes: Concussions can lead to emotional disturbances such as
                                irritability, mood swings, anxiety, depression, and changes in sleep patterns (insomnia
                                or
                                excessive sleepiness).</li>
                            <li>Loss of Consciousness: Although loss of consciousness is not always present in
                                concussions,
                                it can occur in some cases, even if only for a brief period.</li>
                            <li>Amnesia: Temporary memory loss, particularly regarding the events immediately before or
                                after the injury (retrograde and anterograde amnesia, respectively), is a common feature
                                of
                                concussions.</li>
